If you're looking for a good free Windows app to record video while it's playing (like gameplay, streaming video, or screen activity), here are some top free options that work well on Windows 10 and 11:

✅ 1. Xbox Game Bar (Built-in, Free)

How to use : Press Win + G to open the Game Bar, then click the Capture widget (or press Win + Alt + R to start/stop recording).
Pros :
Lightweight and built into Windows.
No need to install extra software.
Cons :
Limited features (no webcam overlay, advanced editing, etc.).
Only records apps/games running in full-screen or UWP mode by default.
✅ 2. OBS Studio (Free & Open Source)
Best for : Customizable, high-quality recordings (great for streaming too).

Record your screen, browser window, game, or even multiple sources.
Add webcam, audio commentary, custom scenes.

✅ 4. Debut Video Capture Software Free

Bonus Tip:
If you're recording web-based videos (e.g., YouTube, Netflix), be aware that DRM-protected content (like Netflix) usually blocks screen recording tools from capturing it properly (black screen). For such cases, paid tools might offer limited workarounds, but always ensure compliance with copyright laws.

If you're looking for an example of how to use Synk (likely referring to Synk.io ) in the context of application security , you've come to the right place.

🔐 What is Snyk?
Snyk is a developer-first tool for finding and fixing vulnerabilities in:

Open-source dependencies (e.g., npm, Maven, PyPI)
Container images
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) like Terraform or Kubernetes manifests
Application code (via SAST)
It integrates directly into your development workflow — from IDEs to CI/CD pipelines.

🧪 Example Use Case: Scanning a Node.js Project with Snyk
Let’s walk through a real-world example : You're a developer working on a Node.js app and want to check for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

✅ Step 1: Install Snyk CLI
You can install Snyk globally using npm:

bash


1
npm install -g snyk
✅ Step 2: Authenticate
Log in via the command line:

bash


1
snyk auth
This will prompt you to log in via your browser and copy-paste an API token.

✅ Step 3: Test Your Project
Navigate to your project directory:

bash


1
cd my-nodejs-project
Run a vulnerability scan:

bash


1
snyk test
This will show all known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, including:

Vulnerability name
Severity (low/medium/high/critical)
Affected package
Suggested fix
Example output:

✗ Low severity vulnerability found in lodash
Description: Prototype Pollution
Info: https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-LODASH-73638 
Introduced through: lodash@4.17.11
From: lodash@4.17.11

Recommendation: Upgrade to lodash@4.17.12 or later.
✅ Step 4: Fix Issues
You can upgrade the vulnerable package:

bash


1
npm upgrade lodash
Then re-scan to verify:

bash


1
snyk test
✅ Step 5: Monitor for New Vulnerabilities
To monitor your project continuously (especially useful in teams):

bash


1
snyk monitor
This links your project to your Snyk account and alerts you when new vulnerabilities are disclosed in your dependencies.

🛠️ Integrating Snyk into CI/CD (GitHub Actions Example)
Here's how you might integrate Snyk into a GitHub Actions pipeline:

          snyk test
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
💡 Store your Snyk API token securely in GitHub Secrets (SNYK_TOKEN).

requests>=2.21.0
Flask==1.1.4
Then install the updated dependency:

bash


1
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
🧪 Step 4: Re-scan to Confirm Fix
Run the scan again:

bash


1
snyk test
If the vulnerability is fixed, it should no longer appear.

📈 Optional: Monitor for Future Vulnerabilities
To monitor your project continuously:

bash


1
snyk monitor
Now, Snyk will notify you if any new vulnerabilities are discovered in your dependencies.

🧰 Bonus: Use snyk wizard for Auto-Fix Guidance
If you want interactive help fixing issues:

bash


1
snyk wizard
It will guide you through patching, upgrading, or configuring fixes.
